# React Interview Preparation Platform

A comprehensive platform for learning React concepts through interactive examples and visualizations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Option 1: Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Option 2: Docker Development

1. Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running
2. Build and run using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Option 3: Docker Production Build

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t nextjs-learning .
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 nextjs-learning
   ```

## üê≥ Docker Configuration

The project includes Docker support for both development and production environments:

- `Dockerfile`: Multi-stage build for production
- `docker-compose.yml`: Development environment with hot-reloading
- `.dockerignore`: Optimized build context

### Development with Docker

The development environment includes:
- Hot-reloading
- Volume mounting for live code updates
- Node modules isolation
- Development-specific configurations

### Production with Docker

The production build includes:
- Multi-stage builds for smaller image size
- Production optimizations
- Security best practices
- Standalone output
